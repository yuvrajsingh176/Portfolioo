## 🚀 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

After downloading/cloning the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This will install all required dependencies.

### 2️⃣ Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, start the server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your portfolio will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### ⚠️ Important: Set Up Environment Variables

Before running the project, make sure to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

This ensures proper configuration of environment variables.

## Customizing the Template

1. Navbar
   - File: navbar.tsx
     - Update the navbar name from john_doe to your name.
2. Hero Section
   - File: hero.tsx
     - Edit the title, description, and optionally, replace the SVG with your image.
3. Projects Section
   - File: content/projects
     - Replace the dummy projects with your own.
     - If you are modifying the properties or going to add new ones, then update types in types.d.ts.
4. Services Section
   - File: appData
     - Add your services with relevant icons. If icons are missing, contact me on LinkedIn or via email.
5. Skills Section
   - File: appData
     - Add your skills with relevant icons. Contact if you can’t find specific icons online.
6. Footer
   - Location: Visit [Flexy UI](http://flexyui.com/)
     - You can replace the default footer or choose from additional variants [from Flexy UI](http://flexyui.com/) (simple or column footer).

## 📨 Configuring the Contact Section

To integrate **Formspree** into your contact form, follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the [Formspree website](https://formspree.io/) and create a new project.
2. Add a new form (you'll get a unique form endpoint URL).
3. Copy the form endpoint and paste it into your `.env.local` file like this:

```env
CONTACT_FORM_ACTION_URL=https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id
```

> Note: This URL is just an endpoint to receive your form submissions. You can use any service of your choice (like Formcarry, Getform, or your own API) if you're not using Formspree.

Make sure the name attributes in your form match what your form handler or service expects (e.g., `name`, `email`, `subject`, `message`).

## Configuring Online Images

To display online images (e.g., from a CDN) in your deployed project, configure allowed image hostnames in next.config.js.

For demo purposes, we’re using Unsplash images. You can use any image host, but be sure to add the hostname in your configuration.

Replace 'unsplash' with your own image `hostnames` if using a different service or add a new object.

## Theming and Styling

We use Tailwind CSS for styling. In `global.css`, you can customize theme variables for all 3 themes.

## SEO & Branding

1. Favicon: Replace the default favicon with your own.
2. Metadata: Update meta title and description in layout.tsx.
3. SEO Files: robots.ts and sitemap.ts are included for search engines.
4. Open Graph Images:
   - Replace `opengraph-image.png` and `twitter-image.png `with custom images.
   - Alternatively, edit `opengraph-image.tsx` to generate images dynamically.
